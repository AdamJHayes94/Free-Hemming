# Free-Hemming
This was a module that I created to check whether the product is in the Trousers category and then show different icons

Under app/code/local/Smart/FreeHemming is my module files
Under app/design is the code added that uses the module in the product view page
all.css is just the css used to initially hide on of the blocks

The blocks that are being hidden/shown are in cms blocks and refer to the <div> class.
